# TechTalkDC -- Topics
Interested in speaking at an upcoming TechTalk DC event? Add your information here via pull request and we'll figure out how make it happen!


## Proposed Topic
* Session Title: Career lessons I’ve learned from my cat 
* Preferred Timeframe: March, April, May — I’m pretty flexible. 
* Event Type: 50-min Lecture
* Summary: Work is serious. The days are long, and it’s hard to go to a Meetup after work when all you want to do is nothing. Continuous education is still important. I want to try a talk that brings levity to a topic that gets people thinking and engaging about their career with those around them— literally in the room, and maybe even back at work the next day. My talk calls upon homemade cat gifs to illustrate that motivation and inspiration can come from a host of places. As I’ve transitioned to a start-up where I’m setting up the Product Design process and the formalized user research process it’s only because I love my job and have fun doing it that I wanted to take on more responsibility and risk. I hope people find their joy, see that others have fun at work, learn a bit about how I’ve been “successful,” or whatever, and enjoy themselves.

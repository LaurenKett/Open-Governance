### Scheduled 10/30/2019
* **Session Title**: Token-based security for web applications using OAuth2 and OpenID Connect
* Event Link: https://www.meetup.com/TechTalkDC/events/264895385/
 * **Preferred Timeframe**: June or September/October
 * **Event Type**: 90 minutes 
 * **Summary**: The token has become a popular pattern for securing web applications. Developers love its conceptual simplicity, and architects appreciate the ability to design applications with nicely decoupled security roles. However, pitfalls lurk in the ease of this token-based security. Within the last decade, two security standards have taken center stage to provide guidance and support for the implementation of robust security infrastructure. These standards are OAuth 2 and OpenID Connect. 
In this presentation, Vladimir Bychkov will cover the basics of these security protocols, explain and demo the authorization flows for different types of applications and provide tips for implementation of centralized authorization service using ASP.NET Core.

 ### Scheduled 11/20/2019
* Session Title: Undercover Scrum Master
* Event Link: https://www.meetup.com/TechTalkDC/events/265881515/
* Preferred Timeframe: November 2019 - February 2020
* Event Type: 50-min Lecture
* Summary: Experience report about a Scrum Master spending two years as a software developer on a Scrum team. I hit a wall coaching a team that did not want to try popular Agile engineering techniques such as Test-Driven Development (TDD) and pair programming. I became a Scrum Master after working on the business analysis and account ownership side of software development and could not speak from personal experience about engineering practices. In order to get some first-hand experience and to gain a new perspective, I chose to spend a couple years as a software developer on a Scrum team and I learned more than I expected.

 ### Scheduled 11/20/2019
* Session Title: Undercover Scrum Master
* Event Link: https://www.meetup.com/TechTalkDC/events/265881515/
* Preferred Timeframe: November 2019 - February 2020
* Event Type: 50-min Lecture
* Summary: Experience report about a Scrum Master spending two years as a software developer on a Scrum team. I hit a wall coaching a team that did not want to try popular Agile engineering techniques such as Test-Driven Development (TDD) and pair programming. I became a Scrum Master after working on the business analysis and account ownership side of software development and could not speak from personal experience about engineering practices. In order to get some first-hand experience and to gain a new perspective, I chose to spend a couple years as a software developer on a Scrum team and I learned more than I expected.
